# Windows Glitch Harvester

## Software details

General file corruptor for windows files, folders and subfolders. 
Its interface is based on RTC's glitch harvester and it features similar corruption compilation and replaying features.
This program is still in early development and can be full of bugs. Use at your own risk

### Features

- Can corrupt any non-locked file on windows
- Can corrupt entire folders and subfolders in a click
- Has a corruption stockpile manager (Saves corruption separated from original data)
- All corruption is based on RNG
- Lots of parameters for precise random targetting inside the files
- Uncorrupts files before recorrupting instead of reloading complete files
- Has auto-backup features, can revert back files to normal after corruption

*/!\ The auto-backup is very useful but isn't flawless.* 

*Do not corrupt files you don't have any other backups of.*

### Planned Features
- File/Folder matching checkup
- Embedded file trees in stockpiles
- Real-Time Process Corruption

There currently isn't any documentation for WGH as it is still early in development.
The interface however is similar to RTC's glitch harvester so its manual could help to understand how it works.
